# Selecting the best Cloud Landing Zone for my purpose

Fortunately, there are a few solutions available that educators can use for their educational or research purposes. You might be wondering, what is the best solution? Well, as ever, it depends: Looking for a solution to create a lab for your course assigned to many students? Do you need a solution where students can study cloud concepts as an individual? Do you need a solution for your research project with just a few students?

Selecting the best cloud solution for education is a matter of selecting the right landing zone for your cloud project for which you can use the flow chart below. Only Microsoft and Amazon public cloud solutions are examined (January 2020).

The landing zone in yellow fits the gap that exists for selecting a public cloud lab environment that can be used by small groups that need a few Public Cloud Services in a controlled environment. The functionality, technical design, installation and management of the Azure4StudentProjects solution is described in the project documentation.
